0.09      2021-06-21 12:03:00-07:00 America/Vancouver
    - Remove Net::DNS as a recommended dependency; it is a hard dependency
      for Email::Valid, which we already depend on.

0.08      2021-01-12 10:55:39-08:00 America/Vancouver
    - Bump minimum required Perl to 5.10; the minimum required for
      Regexp::Common, which is a dependency of Data::FormValidator

0.07      2020-12-30 21:41:49-08:00 America/Vancouver
    - POD corrections; spelling, trailing whitespace
    - Switch to Dist::Zilla Author Bundle

0.05    Wed Nov 25 09:59 PST 2015
    - rewrite tests to be more resilient to possible DNS/mxcheck issues
    - move POD tests into "xt/"

0.04    Thu Nov 12 16:18 PST 2015
    - update tests to use "@cpan.org" instead of "@example.com"; example.com no
      longer has a published MX record and so tests were failing
    - Move to GitHub

0.03    Fri Apr 23 16:57 PDT 2010
    - Switch to Git

0.02    Tue Jan 08 14:26 PST 2007
    - first public release
    - renamed methods to 'FV_email_filter' and 'FV_email'
    - updated 'FV_email_filter' so it now auto-mangles all e-mail addresses to
      lower-case (can be disabled, but default is to lc() the e-mail)

0.01    Wed Jun 13  4:02pm 2007
    - initial version
